# ESP32 based Telegram bot for uPlant

Relies on https://github.com/ultimaterobotics/URTelegram telegram bot

This is the central node of uPlant project, it receives BLE advertisement events from all nearby uPlant devices and makes data available via Telegram - with freeform text interface and synthesized responses from individual plants, with plans to make them fit particular plant's character (as of now all plants have the same neutral and slightly sarcastic attitude)
